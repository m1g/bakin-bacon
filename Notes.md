# Bakin Bacon Notes

Start by building out the simple frameworks on each component, i.e., add the divs, tables, layout, etc. No CSS.

_Adding a '/' will create a link to another 'route' once the router has been added_

>**Layout component** will contain the main layout now so that **App.js** can render the router and the router history

`{ Link }` is built into react-router and allows you to link smoothly between pages instead of reloading on each click.

## React Router

`<Router history={browserHistory}>` keeps track of everything that's happening in the url.
